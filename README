==== Overview ====
Higher Skies is an experimental bukkit plugin that increases
the apparent height limit in Minecraft by lowering the entire
world.

Higher Skies rewrites each map chunk as it is loaded into memory
by stripping off the bottom few layers of the chunk and then
shifting the entire chunk contents down. Finally, Higher Skies
seals the bottom of the chunk with beadrock and adds a marker
block. The marker block ensures that chunks are only rewritten
once.

The first time Higher Skies starts, it will attempt to rewrite all
the chunks loaded around the world spawn. This process can take
a LONG time and consumes a tremendous amount of memory. During the
process, the server may crash. Anticipating this, Higher Skies
saves its work periodically and will pick up the job near where it
left off at the next server start.

It is not recommended that you use Higher Skies on an in-progress
Minecraft world. This plugin is experimental and chest inventories,
redstone states, minecarts, and world decorations may be destroyed
in the chunk rewriting process. In fresh worlds, chunks are rewritten
and marked with the marker block well before they are within the
reach of a player, so content destruction is not a problem.

==== Installation ====
0. BACK UP YOUR WORLD!
1. Create a new startbukkit.sh file
2. Install HigherSkies.jar into your plugins directory
3. Start your server - the config.yml file will be created
4. Open the config.yml file and set the number of blocks to drop
   your world.
5. Reload the server - Chunk processing will begin

==== startbukkit.sh ====
Higher Skies requires all the optimizations java can muster and a
powerful machine to run it on. Use the following startbukkit.sh
script to set java's initial options.
